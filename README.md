The data comes from the Wish platform. Basically, the products listed in the dataset are those that would appear if you type "summer" in the search field of the platform. This dataset contains product listings as well as products ratings and sales performance, which you would not find in other datasets.<br/>
Task is to develop a model for product success and help businesses answer the crucial question "How well is a product likely to sell ?". <br/>
Developed a Random forest model for the same task and tried different models such as Linear regression, Decision tree, Gradient Boosting and Lasso.
